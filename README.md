# IM1003MyHorribleProj
This is a Klee themed minesweeper game I cooked up for my end-of-semester intro to java project.
I would admit the code is horribly inefficient and I intend to revisit this over the holidays.
To run the file, just open up the package in an IDE and run it from there. (I used Eclipse in my case)

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the images/audio used in-game. This is a personal project of mine and I do not intend to use it for commercial purposes.
